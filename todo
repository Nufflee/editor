  ☐ TextArea line number container doesn't decrease in size
  ☐ Tokenize into words instead of lines
  ☐ Use Ctrl to jump over words
  ☐ Refactor TextArea, especailly text editing/cursor handling

  ☐ Add ability for UiElements to have children and base their size and positioning on that
    ☐ Utilize this in TextArea so it can create its own containers
  ☐ Reading and saving files
    ☐ Show current filename in window
  ☐ Text selection
  ☐ Mouse navigation
  ☐ Editor vs File lines
    File lines are all lines contained in a file but Editor lines also include synthetic lines created by the editor to help with wrapping. Editor lines do not get line numbers.
  ☐ Ligatures
    ☐ HarfBuzz

      ☐ Examples
        Uses freetype to load and rasterize fonts, harfbuzz to extract glyphs and SDL to create a window and render text: https://github.com/lxnt/ex-sdl-freetype-harfbuzz

Improvements:
  ☐ Use `Window` size everywhere instead of getting the size myself every time
  ☐ Use a fuckin Makefile

  ☐ Make (keyboard) navigation more stateful
    ☐ Keep starting column when navigating up/down
    ☐ Always navigate to the end of the line after using `End`
  ☐ Performance improvements
    ☐ It may be possible to make font rendering more efficient
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29064904/how-to-render-fonts-and-text-with-sdl2-efficiently
    ☐ Pass all big structures by &
  ☐ Add more abstractions in case I switch to pure OpenGL at some point
  ☐ File explorer

Bugs:
  ☐ Fix word wrapping
    This will require tokenization to words instead of lines.
    ☐ Words shouldn't be cut when they cross the wrapping boundary
    ☐ Also put words on the next line if there's a space after it so space is not the first chracter on a line because it looks weird
