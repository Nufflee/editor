Improvements:
  ☐ Use `Window` size everywhere instead of getting the size myself every time
  ☐ Add ability for UiElements to have children and base their size and positioning on that
  ☐ Use a fuckin Makefile

  ☐ Make (keyboard) navigation more stateful
    ☐ Keep starting column when navigating up/down
    ☐ Always navigate to the end of the line after using `End`
  ☐ Performance improvements
    ☐ It may be possible to make font rendering more efficient

    ☐ Pass all big structures by &
  ☐ Add more abstractions in case I switch to pure OpenGL at some point
  ☐ File explorer

Bugs:
  ☐ Fix word wrapping
    This will require tokenization to words instead of lines.
    ☐ Words shouldn't be cut when they cross the wrapping boundary
    ☐ Also put words on the next line if there's a space after it so space is not the first chracter on a line because it looks weird
